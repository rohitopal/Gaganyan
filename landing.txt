									LANDING SEQUENCE IS NOW INTIATED
       INSTRUCTION:
		1)Make sure you decelate the vehicle to less than 5021.09m/s.
		2)Decelarate the vehicle by pressing continuous 's' key and press 'w' to stop engines.
		2)for succesful landing reduce the velocity to enter smallest possible orbit above 5000m from the 
		  surface of mars.
		3)Once entered in a stable orbit release the lander probe where the astronauts are placed.
			a)if the velocity while moving to earth increases to the heat shield might fail resulting
			  in an explosion.
		4)Open the parechute to reduce the speed of impact to the ground.
			a)if the velocity is while landing greater than 10m/s then the probe will be damaged causing
			  failure of mission.
